# TestaSpallaSPMProject

## Introduction:

The project aims to create a smart parking infrastructure, i.e. the possibility for each driver of a vehicle to be able to know before entering the city whether there is a parking space and, if present, reserve it.
The basic idea is to reduce urban pollution as much as possible, avoiding the driver wasting time traveling around the city in search of a parking space and consequent waste of fuel. Consequently, traffic inside city centers will also be significantly reduced.

### Description:

The system will be equipped with an application that integrates a navigator, so that the driver can be guided step by step towards the destination he has to reach, and then be notified of the parking closest to it and then be guided to the parking, all upon registration by the user.
In the overall project, the app described above will be developed, a web application to be provided to the police, an application to be provided to the municipality for the management of parking lots and finally a last one for the company that deals with the creation of spaces and management expenses and revenues from the use of parking lots where they are subject to a fee.
During this first phase, only the development of the API and the related application dedicated to the driver will be taken into consideration.
